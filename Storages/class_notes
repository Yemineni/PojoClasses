Storages:
    - AngularJS supports two types of Storages.
        - localStorage
        - sessionStorage

    - as a developer we must delete the local storage explicitely.

    - when ever we "close the browser" / "opens the new tab" we will lost
      the data from sessionStorage.

    - "ngStorage" is the predefined module and it will supports the Storages.

    - "ngStorage" module have following predefined objects.

        1) $localStorage
        2) $sessionStorage

    -  $localStorage is the predefined object used to work with the local storage.

    -  $sessionStorage is the predefined Object used to work with the sessionStorage.

    -  we can store the data in the form of a "key&value" pairs.


localStorage
------------
//store the data
$localStorage.poc = {"uname":"admin","upwd":"admin"};
              (key) (value)


//read the data.
var obj = $localStorage.poc;
console.log(obj.uname+"..."+obj.upwd);

//delete the data
delete $localStorage.poc;

sessionStorage
--------------
//store the data
$sessionStorage.poc = {"uname":"admin","upwd":"admin"};
              (key) (value)

//read the data.
var obj = $sessionStorage.poc;
console.log(obj.uname+"..."+obj.upwd);

//delete the data
delete $sessionStorage.poc;
